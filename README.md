My idea is to create a database on the mushrooms in the area of Gainesville to help beginner foragers to identify and to learn about the different components of mushrooms. This will be for educational purposes only. The database will have components to help the user rule out possibilities by having the user specify the characteristics of the unidentified mushroom.
